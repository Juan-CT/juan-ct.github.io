# Juan-CT's Portfolio v1.0

Welcome to my humble portfolio. This repository contains its basic structure, along with some of the projects I have created along the way to learn and improve my skills. For now, the portfolio is very simple, but I have the intention to make it more complex and add more projects in the future.

## Main Page

In the initial version, the index page structure is entirely built into the file, using HTML and CSS.
No JavaScript or frameworks were used. The goal was to work directly with HTML elements and CSS.

## Projects

So far, my projects are mainly exercises from my vocational training, but extended with additional functionalities and polished.

#### Star Wars DB

This website was initially created to practice CSS and JavaScript for my exams. 
After the exams, I added several lines to the script and many CSS properties to make the page responsive, along with some design improvements for a better appearance. 
The code structure is a bit messy since my main focus was on practicing and getting things to work.

#### Cinema Paradiso

This small project comes from an exercise I did for the JavaScript module I was in. 
The information is saved locally, with no server, database or API involved.
The JavaScript files are organized and separated into folders according to their function. 
I aimed to simulate the structure of frameworks to gain practice in organization.

#### Currency Converter

I created this app to practice for the final exams of the JavaScript module. 
The code is only in a single archive, but it is commented to make it easier to understand.
